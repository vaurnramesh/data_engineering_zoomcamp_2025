# Overview

We are setting up terraform in our project for the following courses

## 1.3.2 GCP Overview

### Project infrastructure modules in GCP:
* Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Data Lake
* BigQuery: Data Warehouse

(Concepts explained in Week 2 - Data Ingestion)

### Initial Setup

For this course, we'll use a free version (upto EUR 300 credits). 

1. Create an account with your Google email ID 
2. Setup your first [project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) if you haven't already
    * eg. "DTC DE Course", and note down the "Project ID" (we'll use this later when deploying infra with TF)
3. Setup [service account & authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for this project
    * Grant `Viewer` role to begin with.
    * Download service-account-keys (.json) for auth.
4. Download [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) for local setup
5. Set environment variable to point to your downloaded GCP keys:
   ```shell
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
   
   # Refresh token/session, and verify authentication
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   
### Setup for Access
 
1. [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) for Service account:
   * Go to the *IAM* section of *IAM & Admin* https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam
   * Click the *Edit principal* icon for your service account.
   * Add these roles in addition to *Viewer* : **Storage Admin** + **Storage Object Admin** + **BigQuery Admin**
   
2. Enable these APIs for your project:
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com
   
3. Please ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env-var is set.
   ```shell
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
   ```

### Concepts

#### Introduction

1. What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)?
   * open-source tool by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), used for provisioning infrastructure resources
   * supports DevOps best practices for change management
   * Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state 
     for testing and production environments
2. What is IaC?
   * Infrastructure-as-Code
   * build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way 
     by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.
3. Some advantages
   * Infrastructure lifecycle management
   * Version control commits
   * Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8Sâ€¦
   * State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments


#### Files

* `main.tf`
* `variables.tf`
* Optional: `resources.tf`, `output.tf`
* `.tfstate`

#### Declarations
* `terraform`: configure basic Terraform settings to provision your infrastructure
   * `required_version`: minimum Terraform version to apply to your configuration
   * `backend`: stores Terraform's "state" snapshots, to map real-world resources to your configuration.
      * `local`: stores state file locally as `terraform.tfstate`
   * `required_providers`: specifies the providers required by the current module
* `provider`:
   * adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage
   * The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.
* `resource`
  * blocks to define components of your infrastructure
  * Project modules/resources: google_storage_bucket, google_bigquery_dataset, google_bigquery_table
* `variable` & `locals`
  * runtime arguments and constants


#### Execution steps
1. `terraform init`: 
    * Initializes & configures the backend, installs plugins/providers, & checks out an existing configuration from a version control 
2. `terraform plan`:
    * Matches/previews local changes against a remote state, and proposes an Execution Plan.
3. `terraform apply`: 
    * Asks for approval to the proposed plan, and applies changes to cloud
4. `terraform destroy`
    * Removes your stack from the Cloud
