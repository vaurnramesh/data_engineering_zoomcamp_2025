# Analytics Engineering

## 4.1.1 Analytics Engineering Basics

In a traditional data team, we recognize the data engineer, the data analyst, and sometimes the data scientist. The data engineer prepares and maintains the infrastructure the data team needs. The data analyst uses the data hosted in that infrastructure to answer questions and solve problems.

With recent developments, data scientists and analysts are writing more code, but they are not trained as software engineers, and this is not their primary focus. Similarly, data engineers, while excellent software engineers, lack training in how the data is used by business users.

This gap is where the analytics engineer comes in. The role combines elements of the data engineer and the data analyst. It introduces good software engineering practices from the data engineer to the efforts of data analysts and scientists.

The analytics engineer may be exposed to the following tools:

- Data Loading (Stitch, Apache NiFi, Airbyte)
- Data Storing (Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift)
- Data Modeling (dbt, Dataform, Apache Spark SQL)
- Data Presentation (Looker, Tableau, Google Data Studio, Power BI, Metabase)

This module, we’ll focus on the last two areas: data modeling and presentation

### Data Modelling Concepts

**ETL vs. ELT**

In ETL, we extract the sources, transform the data, and then load it into a data warehouse. In ELT, we load the data into the data warehouse first and then transform it.

The first approach takes longer to implement because we must transform the data upfront. However, this results in more stable and compliant data because it is clean. On the other hand, ELT is faster and more flexible because the data is already loaded.

This approach leverages cloud data warehousing, which has lowered the cost of storage and compute. Without those restrictions, we can afford to load all our data first and transform it within the data warehouse.

We will now dive deeper into the transformation step.

**Kimball's Dimensional Modeling**

Kimball's Dimensional Modeling is a methodology for designing data warehouses. It was introduced by Ralph Kimball
and is an approach to Data Warehouse design which focuses on 2 main points:

- Deliver data that is understandable to the business
- Deliver fast query performance

Other goals such as reducing redundant data (prioritized by other approaches) are secondary. We are not going to
focus heavily on making sure that data is not redundant; instead, we prioritize user understandability of this
data and query performance.

Kimball's Dimensional Modeling uses Star Schema Design as its primary approach for organizing data in a data 
warehouse. This design ensures the data is easy to query, supports high performance, and aligns with the analytical
needs of businesses.

**Elements of Dimensional Modeling**

We are going to be talking mainly about two types of tables. Fact tables and dimensional tables. This is also 
known as the star schema.

- Fact tables: The central table in the schema. Contains quantitative data, metrics, or measurements that 
represent business processes (e.g., sales, revenue, or inventory counts). Includes foreign keys that link to the dimension tables.

- Dimensions tables: provide context to these fact tables. Contain attributes (details) about dimensions such as 
time, product, customer, or location.

The star schema is a type of database schema that is widely used in data warehousing and business intelligence 
for organizing and querying data. It is called "star schema" because its structure resembles a star shape when 
visualized: a central fact table is surrounded by multiple dimension tables.

The star schema simplifies data organization for analytics and reporting while prioritizing performance and ease
of use over strict normalization. Dimension tables can store repeated data, which consumes more storage compared
to normalized schemas.

**Architecture of Dimensional Modeling**

An analogy that is presented in Kimball's dimensional modeling is the kitchen analogy. The book compares
how the data warehouse and the ETL process could be compared with a restaurant:

- Staging Area: Here, we have the raw data. This is not meant to be exposed to everyone but only to those who 
 know how to use that raw data. In the case of a restaurant, this would be the food in its raw state before being 
 processed.

- Processing Area: This is the kitchen in a restaurant. Here, raw data is processed and turned into data models.
 Again, this is limited to those who know how to do this, such as the cooks. The focus is on efficiency and 
 ensuring standards are followed.

- Presentation Area: This is the dining hall and represents the final presentation of the data. Here, the data 
 is exposed to business stakeholders.
